# Manual for the BSB-LAN Hard- & Software  
   
The BSB-LPB-LAN adapter and the [BSB-LAN software](https://github.com/fredlcore/bsb_lan) allow you to monitor and control your heating system.  
It works with many units from different manufacturers (e.g. Br√∂tje, Elco), if they have certain types of a Siemens controller inside.  
   
To get more informations about this, start by reading the [introduction of the manual](https://1coderookie.github.io/BSB-LPB-LAN_EN/index2.html) at the GitHub Pages.

A printer-friendly PDF-version of these pages is available [here](https://github.com/1coderookie/BSB-LPB-LAN_EN/raw/master/Manual_BSB-LPB-LAN-Adapter.pdf). Because it's generated automatically out of the content of the GitHub Pages, some links within the document don't work.
