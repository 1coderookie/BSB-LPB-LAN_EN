# 17. Further Informations and Sources
A lively exchange regarding the here presented hardware and software
takes place in the following forum:   [https://forum.fhem.de/index.php/topic,29762.0.html](https://forum.fhem.de/index.php/topic,29762.0.html)  
This is also a good place for questions, exchange of experience and
support, including informations about updates.  
  
All documentation for the hardware and software presented here
as well as the different software versions can be found [here](https://github.com/fredlcore/bsb_lan).  
This manual is also available [here](https://github.com/1coderookie/BSB-LPB-LAN_EN/raw/master/BSB-LPB-LAN-manual.pdf) as a PDF version.

The software and related documentation for the use of the
here presented adapter in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi 2 is available 
[here](https://github.com/loehnertj/bsbgateway).

For the use of the adapter with an RPi at the PPS interface the Python script ["PPS-monitor"](https://github.com/dspinellis/PPS-monitor) can be used.

The initial idea of connecting some kind of adapter for gaining access  via BSB/LPB and the process that led to this solution can be found [here](http://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/218643) and [here](http://blog.dest-unreach.be/2012/12/14 reverse engineering-the-elco-heating-protocol).  
    
As a relatively extensive source with many parameter descriptions
the "Br√∂tje System Manual ISR Plus" is recommended to read. Besides 
numerous other and model-specific instructions it's like a basic 'reference' for the parameter definitions.  

For informations about the different controllers it's always worthy searching for "Albatros 2". 

In-depth informations such as specifications and technical
requirements of the bus types can be found in the respective documents of the manufacturer.
Especially regarding the LPB, two documents from "Siemens Building
Technologies - Landis & Staefa Division" are recommended: 
- CE1N2030D Local Process Bus LPB system basics
- CE1N2032D Local Process Bus LPB Configuration Basics

Regarding the installation and usage of DHT22 and
OneWire sensors such as the DS18B20 there are numerous sources of information. Especially the official DataSheets of the manufacturers should be read. Besides the already mentioned documents in the specific chapters, there are many free tutorials, example installations and scripts available throughout the internet.
