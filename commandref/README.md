***Localized Command References***

Here you'll find localized versions of the URL command reference (so called 'cheatsheet') as a printer-friendly PDF version.  
  
For a comprehensive description please see [chapter 8](https://1coderookie.github.io/BSB-LPB-LAN_EN/chap08.html).  
  
If you are a native speaker of a specific language which isn't covered by the existing cheatsheets yet and you'd like to translate it, please feel free to contact me via email.
