# 12. Excursus: Arduino IDE

In the following, the use of the Arduino IDE and the installation of the required board libraries for the Arduino Due and the ESP32 will be briefly described.  
Finally, the use of the Serial Monitor (SerMo) of the Arduino IDE is briefly presented, which can be used to e.g. observe the startup behavior of the Arduino Due/ESP32, and to identify any errors which may occur more easily.

## 12.1 Installation

**Installation of the Arduino IDE**  
  
Download and install the latest version of the Arduino IDE from [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for your operating system (Windows, Mac and Linux version available).  

---

### 12.1.1 Arduino Due
  
**Installation of the Specific Libraries**    
  
1. Start the Arduino IDE and open the "Board Manager" under "Tools/Board".  
2. In the dialog box that opens, type "Arduino SAM Boards" in the search line at the top where the Due is included.  
3. Click on the entry "Arduino SAM Boards (32-bits ARM Cortex-M3) by Arduino" and then on the "Install" button.

   *The correctly installed SAM framework (ARM Cortex-M3) for the Arduino Due in the board manager.*  

Now you should be able to find and select the Due in the listing at "Tools/Board".

### 12.1.2 ESP32
  
**Installation of the Specific Libraries**    
  
1. Start the Arduino IDE and click on "File/Preferences" (Shortcut: Ctrl+Comma).  
2. In the dialog window that opens now insert the following link in the input field at the bottom of "Additional board manager URLs": `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`. If there are already one or more URLs in the field, the additional entry can simply be added to the existing entries separated by a comma.  
3. Then click on "OK".  
   
   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1coderookie/BSB-LPB-LAN_EN/master/docs/pics/boardverwalter_URL_202.png">  

   *The "Preferences" dialog box with the added link in the "Additional board manager URLs" line.*  

4. Next, open the "Board Manager" under "Tools/Board".  
5. In the dialog box that opens, type "ESP32" in the search line at the top. 
6. Then search for the entry "esp32 by Espressif Systems". 
7. Click on the entry, *select version 2.0.2* (or higher if available) and then click on the "Install" button. **If you have a version lower than 2.0.2 installed, please update to 2.0.2 (or higher).**   

   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1coderookie/BSB-LPB-LAN_EN/master/docs/pics/boardverwalter_esp32-lib_202.png">  

   *The correctly installed ESP32 framework in the board manager.*  

Now you should be able to find and select the ESP32 board in the listing at "Tools/Board".

## 12.2 Serial Monitor

**Using the Serial Monitor**  

The Serial Monitor (short: SerMo) is a useful tool to observe e.g. the startup behavior and the data traffic of the microcontroller. So it is possible to find errors or to record unknown telegrams.  

To use the SerMo please proceed as follows:  
- Connect your BSB-LAN setup via USB to your computer.  
- Start the Arduino IDE by double clicking on the file *BSB_LAN.ino*.  
- Now select your board type, port etc. accordingly. 
- Now start the "Serial Monitor". This can be done either via "Tools/Serial Monitor" (Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+M) or simply by clicking on the magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner of the Arduino IDE toolbar.  

The moment you start the Serial Monitor, the connected microcontroller (Due/ESP32) will be restarted.  

If you have configured everything correctly, you can observe the startup process and the sending and receiving of telegrams (an exemplary output can be found at the end of this chapter).  
However, if only illegible cryptic characters appear, check the setting of the transmission rate: this is at the bottom right and should be set to 115200 baud.  

It is also a good idea to check "Timestamp" and to set "Both NL and CR" in the field to the left of the transmission rate.    

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1coderookie/BSB-LPB-LAN_EN/master/docs/pics/sermo_untere-zeile.png">  

*The bottom line of the SerMo with the corresponding settings.*  

If you send URL commands via the web interface, for example, you will see the corresponding commands or telegrams in the SerMo output. Regularly arriving INF telegrams are broadcasts that are sent by the heating controller or by the connected control unit and possibly also by an additional room device. The boiler temperature is sent from the control unit approximately every ten seconds, and the room temperature is usually sent from a room unit.  

If you now call up a certain parameter on the control unit, for example, then this parameter and the corresponding value are not only shown on the display of the control unit, but also in SerMo. In this way, for example, unknown, new parameters of a heating controller and their associated telegrams can be decoded (see [chap. 09](chap09.md)). 

*Note:*  
If you contact us (Frederik and me, Ulf) with questions or problems, you will most likely get a request to send a "SerMo log". This means that you should create a log of the SerMo output.  
To do this, uncheck "Autoscroll" at the bottom left of the SerMo window (so that the output doesn't scroll regularly) and then select the desired lines with the mouse. With copy&paste you can paste the output into a text editor and save the file as txt-file (or post it in the forum pasted in codetags).  

The following is an example of a SerMo output of a successful start of a BSB LAN setup with an Arduino Due and a connected RVS43 controller including INF messages of the connected control unit, which sends the boiler temperature as a broadcast approx. every ten seconds:
