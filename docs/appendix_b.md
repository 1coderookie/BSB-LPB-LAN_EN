## B1 Arduino DUE  
  
***The following 'inofficial' Arduino DUE pinout diagram was made by [Rob Gray](https://www.robgray.com).  
It is also directly available as a [PDF](http://www.robgray.com/temp/Due-pinout.pdf).  
Many thanks for that great work!***  
  
*Note: Please note that the pinout of some cheap clones may vary from the original pinout!*
