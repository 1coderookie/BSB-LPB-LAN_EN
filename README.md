# Manual for the BSB-LPB-LAN Adapter and the BSB-LAN Software.  

*The bad news: Sorry, the translation of this manual from the [German language version](https://1coderookie.github.io/BSB-LPB-LAN) isn't completely done yet.. :(  
The good news: I'm working on it actually.. ;)*
   
The BSB-LPB-LAN adapter and the BSB-LAN software allow you to monitor and control your heating system.  
It works with many units from different manufacturers (e.g. Br√∂tje, Elco), if they have certain types of a Siemens controller inside.  
   
To get more informations about this, start by reading the [preface of the manual](https://1coderookie.github.io/BSB-LPB-LAN_EN) at the GitHub Pages.
